    Whenever this creature transforms into Werewolf Ransacker, you may
    destroy target artifact. If that artifact is put into a graveyard
    this way, Werewolf Ransacker deals 3 damage to that artifact's
    controller.

    At the beginning of each upkeep, if a player cast two or more spells
    last turn, transform Werewolf Ransacker.
