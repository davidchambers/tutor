    Flying

    At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on
    Phantasmal Sphere, then sacrifice Phantasmal Sphere unless
    you pay {1} for each +1/+1 counter on it.

    When Phantasmal Sphere leaves the battlefield, put a blue Orb
    creature token with flying onto the battlefield under target
    opponent's control. That creature's power and toughness are each
    equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on Phantasmal Sphere.
