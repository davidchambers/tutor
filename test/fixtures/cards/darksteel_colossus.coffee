      Lethal damage, damage from a source with deathtouch, and effects
      that say "destroy" won't cause an indestructible creature to be
      put into the graveyard. However, an indestructible creature can
      be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most
      likely reasons are if it's sacrificed or if its toughness is 0
      or less. (In these cases, of course, Darksteel Colossus would
      be shuffled into its owner's library instead of being put into
      its owner's graveyard.)
