# Tutor

[Gatherer][1] is the canonical source for _Magic: The Gathering_ card details.
While useful, it lacks an interface for retrieving this data programmatically.
The lack of an API makes creating _Magic_-related applications unnecessarily
difficult.

Tutor provides an API for Gatherer. It's a lightweight [Express][2] app that
reads data from Gatherer and returns neatly formatted JSON.

## Starting the app

To run the server:

    $ npm install
    $ coffee server

This starts a server listening on the port set as the environment variable PORT,
or on port 3000 if PORT is undefined.

## GET /card/:id

Returns a JSON representation of the card specified (by Gatherer id) in the
request path. The response includes version-specific metadata such as flavor
text and rarity.

![Flame Javelin][4]

## GET /card/:id/:part

Returns a JSON representation of the specified part of the specified multipart
card. For example, `GET /card/27166/Ice` returns the Ice half of Fire and Ice.

![Fire and Ice][5]

## GET /card/:name

Returns a JSON representation of the specified card. The response does *not*
include version-specific metadata such as flavor text and rarity.

## Attributes

These attributes may be included in a response:

  - `name`
  - `mana_cost`
  - `converted_mana_cost`
  - `types`
  - `subtypes`
  - `text`
  - `flavor_text`
  - `flavor_text_attribution`
  - `color_indicator`
  - `watermark`
  - `power`
  - `toughness`
  - `loyalty`
  - `expansion`
  - `rarity`
  - `number`
  - `artist`
  - `gatherer_url`
  - `versions`
  - `rulings`

Attributes not applicable to the card type (e.g. lands have no mana cost) or
not present (e.g. certain creatures have no rules text) are omitted.

## GET /language/:id or GET /language/:name

Return the JSON representation of the available translations of the specified
card (by Gatherer id) or by name. The result is an object with the keys are
language codes (or culture codes when needed), and the values are also objects
with the following properties:

  - `name` - translated name of the card
  - `id` - multiverse id of the translated card

Example:

    {
      "es": {
        "name": "Ave del paraiso",
        "id": 265034
      }
    }


## GET /set/:name/:page?

Returns a page of cards (up to 25) from the specified set. The first page of
results is returned if `page` is omitted. Responses contain `page`, `pages`,
and `cards`. For example:

    page: 1
    pages: 5
    cards: [...]

Each card in `cards` contains all applicable attributes among the following:

  - `name`
  - `mana_cost`
  - `converted_mana_cost`
  - `types`
  - `subtypes`
  - `text`
  - `power`
  - `toughness`
  - `loyalty`
  - `expansion`
  - `rarity`
  - `gatherer_url`
  - `versions`
